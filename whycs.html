		<h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
	
		<div>
		
		<p>Well, originally CS wasn't where I was going to go. I was trying to go for IT. I had gone to Job Corps for 2.5 years after my dark times, I was IT certified in A+ and Windows 7, I was a computer technician and I liked doing it. It was the sort of profession that could make money for someone that has wanted be in the creative fields all their life but as the eldest child had to make responsible choices.</p>
		
		<p>I was taking classes for IT as I went to Northern Virginia Community College post-Job Corps and started looking around for IT programs at 4 year schools.</p>
		
		<p>And you know what? Every single one sounded more like I was double majoring in business than I was being a computer technician. It sounded boring. But you know what didn't sound boring? that Web Programming class I took. That got me excited. That got me interested. It was basic coding, sure, but I had never realized the power that came in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap until I had a class in it and I realized that this was the sort of thing I could enjoy doing. Coding seemed fun and interesting and powerful and had the potential to be creative for someone like me.</p>
		
		<p>I had a basic programming structure class and it turned out I liked it and I had a great mind for computer logic. Once I took a JAVA class it seemed like it was the right choice for me, so here I am, very interested in getting into programming. Web Programming seems like my way to go, but I enjoyed JAVA too and that has its own myriad applications. I can't wait to try out other programming languages to see what suits me.</p>
		
		<p>Either way, that's why Computer Science. It's a fascinating growing field that is always needed and has a finger in every pie on the planet. So if it's fun and interesting, why not.
